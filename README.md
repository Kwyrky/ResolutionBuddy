ResolutionBuddy
===============

A simple thing for managing the window resolution of an XNA/MonoGame game

Base on code from <a href="http://www.david-amador.com/2010/03/xna-2d-independent-resolution-rendering/">david-amador.com</a>

To see an example of how to use this library, check out <a href="https://github.com/dmanning23/ResolutionBuddyExample">ResolutionBuddyExample</a>

This library has been tested on Windows and Ouya.  Other platforms supported by XNA and MonoGame would be easy to implement.

Note: This lib uses a couple of submodules, so make sure to run "git submodule init; git submodule update" after cloning.
